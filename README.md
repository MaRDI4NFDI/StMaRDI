# StMaRDI
This is a repository to store notebooks of statistical analysis in graphical modelling and causal inference (MaRDI Project, TA3)

Here we provide the short description of the available notebooks. 

Notebook_01 - introduction to the problem of graphical modelling and causal inference. Implementation of the algorithms available in the package __bnlearn__ on the dataset __alarm__ which were collected from Zenodo repository.  
Notebook_02 - introduction to the problem of subgraph (subset) selection in a "large" graph with available ground truth such that the independence relationships in the selected graph do not contradict to the ones in the supergraph. Implementation of different heuristics based on __alarm__ graph and their benchmarking. 
Notebook_03 - based on the data collected by telekom company estimate which covariate cause clients to become churn. Also a comparison to known methods which provide feature importance is presented. This notebook can also serve as an introductory notebook in the courses of statistical analysis.  
Notebook_04 - benchmarking datasets from Tuebingen cause-effect repository by means of a statistical test which uses kernel-based HSIC methodology. 
Notebook_04 - a notebook which introduces the problem of DAG estimation as a non-convex optimization problem over euclidean space. Implementation uses dataset from __Bayesys__ collection collected and published earlier in zenodo community.
