### Coronary heart disease data set

## Description

Probable risk factors for coronary thrombosis, comprising data from 1841 men.

## Usage
```{r}
library(bnlearn)
data(coronary)
```

## Format

The coronary data set contains the following 6 variables:

    Smoking (smoking): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

    M. Work (strenuous mental work): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

    P. Work (strenuous physical work): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

    Pressure (systolic blood pressure): a two-level factor with levels <140 and >140.

    Proteins (ratio of beta and alpha lipoproteins): a two-level factor with levels <3 and >3.

    Family (family anamnesis of coronary heart disease): a two-level factor with levels neg and pos.
