# Custom Online Data Extraction

There are a lot of important areas for **Graphical Modelling and Causal Inference** on tabular data. Below is a list of **categories** and useful websites for custom data extraction:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Economic & Financial Data**

Economic and financial data often involve causal relationships, such as how inflation affects employment or how policies impact market behavior.

**Possible datasets:**

-   GDP, inflation, and trade data

-   Stock market and financial transactions

-   Household income and economic indicators

**Example sources:**

-   [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)

-   [OECD Data](https://www.oecd.org/en/data.html)

-   [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Social & Behavioral Data**

Understanding human behavior, social interactions, and cultural influences can be crucial in causal inference.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Social network analysis (Facebook, Twitter datasets)

-   Behavioral economics studies

-   Social mobility and inequality data

**Example sources:**

-   [General Social Survey (GSS)](https://gss.norc.org/)

-   [Pew Research Data](https://www.pewresearch.org/)

-   [European Social Survey (ESS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Environmental & Ecological Data**

Climate change, pollution, and biodiversity studies require causal modeling for impact assessment.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions

-   Biodiversity and species distribution

-   Air and water quality

**Example sources:**

-   [NASA Earth Data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)

-   [Copernicus Climate Data](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)

-   [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Engineering & Sensor Data**

Sensor-based datasets (IoT, industrial processes, robotics) can provide time-series data for causal discovery.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Smart cities and traffic monitoring

-   Industrial machine failure predictions

-   Energy consumption and grid stability

**Example sources:**

-   [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/)

-   [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Political & Legal Data**

Causal models can analyze policy effects, election predictions, and legal case outcomes.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Election results and voter behavior

-   Government spending and policy impact

-   Legal case rulings and sentencing patterns

**Example sources:**

-   [Congressional Voting Records](https://www.govtrack.us/)

-   [Comparative Political Data Set (CPDS)](https://www.cpds-data.org/)

-   [World Justice Project Rule of Law Index](https://worldjusticeproject.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Transportation & Mobility Data**

Causal analysis in urban planning, traffic patterns, and logistics is crucial for optimizing transport systems.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Public transportation ridership data

-   Road traffic and accident reports

-   Flight delays and logistics performance

**Example sources:**

-   [U.S. Department of Transportation Open Data](https://data.transportation.gov/)

-   [NYC Open Data (Taxi & Traffic Data)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Taxi/mch6-rqy4)

-   [OpenStreetMap Traffic Data](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Education Data**

Educational outcomes are often influenced by multiple factors (socioeconomic status, school policies, etc.), making them ideal for causal modeling.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Student performance and test scores

-   School funding and academic achievement

-   Higher education statistics

**Example sources:**

-   [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/)

-   [OECD Education at a Glance](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2024_c00cad36-en.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Crime & Justice Data**

Understanding the causal effects of policies, policing, and social factors on crime rates is crucial.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Crime rates and law enforcement reports

-   Prison population statistics

-   Impact of social programs on crime reduction

**Example sources:**

-   [FBI Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/)

-   [Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)](https://bjs.ojp.gov/)

-   [UK Crime Data](https://data.police.uk/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Energy & Sustainability Data**

Causal relationships between energy consumption, economic growth, and environmental policies are important.

**Possible datasets:**

-   Renewable energy production

-   Electricity grid performance

-   Carbon footprint analysis

**Example sources:**

-   [International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)
